# <a href='https://kumarbiomaterials.org/'> Kumar Biomaterials Laboratory </a>

## Goal: 
### The Kumar Lab will create discovery pipelines for identifying clinically useful and affordable biomaterials, fulfilling diverse therapeutic needs. Members of the Kumar Lab will apply polymer synthesis, surface engineering, and statistical models to develop novel biomaterials.

## Description:
### The following codes are used to streamline data anlysis in our lab. As of now, our titration code is used to calculate the pKa of our polymers. The code reorganizes data outputted from our autotitrator, plots our titration curve along with a derivative plot to locate inflection points, then uses the chi-squared test to best approximate our polymer pKas. The differential scanning fluroimetry (DSF) code analyzes the melting temperature of our polplexes: a combination of ribonucleoproteins and Cas9. The code plots the melting curve of our polyplexes and a derivative plot to determine the melting point location on our melting curve plot. 

## Instructions:
### Comments have been left throughought each line of code to help provide detail on what's happening. Note: the titration code uses Google Colab, while the DSF code does not. 

## Credits:
### I would like to thank Dr. Beeler (@sbeeler) for her involvement with creating my titration code. I would also like to thank Camden Fritz (@camdenfritz) for his involvement
