# <a href='https://kumarbiomaterials.org/'> Kumar Biomaterials Laboratory </a>

## Goal: 
### The Kumar Lab will create discovery pipelines for identifying clinically useful and affordable biomaterials, fulfilling diverse therapeutic needs. Members of the Kumar Lab will apply polymer synthesis, surface engineering, and statistical models to develop novel biomaterials.

## Description:
### The following codes are used for plotting graphs for data anlysis and presentation. There are data files within each folder that can be used to guide yourself through using the code for plotting.
